# 🧠 Command Center Agent Orchestration with LangGraph

This repository demonstrates a multi-agent system built using [LangGraph](https://langgraph.dev/), organized around a **Command Center architecture**. 
In this design, all specialized agents report back to a central controller, which manages the conversation state and decides the next best agent to invoke.

The system mimics a **command-and-control structure**:

- 🧭 **Command Center**: The central agent that maintains state and directs traffic based on current progress.
- 🔍 **Analysis Agent**: Extracts insights from incoming messages.
- ✍️ **Writing Agent**: Generates written content based on the analysis.
- ✅ **Feedback Agent**: Evaluates written output and suggests improvements.
- 🔁 **Control Flow**: All agents report back to the Command Center after execution. No agent directly invokes another.

This flow ensures:

- ✅ Clean separation of concerns  
- ✅ Transparent, traceable decision-making  
- ✅ Easier state management and checkpointing  
- ✅ Modular and reusa
